## Signals of Trust in Science

Original "tweet storm" drafting area below.

Just some thoughts.  Comment via tweet, github issue, pull request, etc.

My personal focus is in how to **automate** publishing, tracking, and reasoning about signals like these, not just in science.  Doing this in the [W3C Credible Web Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/)

Some examples of how this might be approached:

* Machine readable signals of robust debate could come from marking up the structure of the debate, that certain posts rebut others, and evolving votes from participants in the debate.  Would be good to have strong identity and role data of participants.
* Links to raw data seem easy enough.  It would be good to add links to usage of that data, to help confirm it works
* For jobs, one might want to use a toxonomy of scientific fields, and job roles, hopefully with some metadata about conceptual distance between items.  Here, you'd like the data to be sourced from the employer, ideally, except that employers often have slightly nutty (detached from reality) ideas about people's jobs.  So maybe employer posts very broadly that person is employed and some indicators of the role, employee posts more details, and we trust misalignment to be socially detected and corrected.
* For opennes to changing?  I dunno.  History of changing is one thing, but if you're never wrong :-) you wont have that.  Maybe there are some affirmations of willingness to change that people can publicly sign?
* etc...
